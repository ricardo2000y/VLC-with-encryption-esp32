# Secure Visible Light Communication V1.0
This Open source project is a secure visible light communication system that uses the ESP32-S3 system-on-chip, to interface, encrypt and decrypt the data to be transmitted and received. The system uses a UART protocol and OOK modulation to transmit the data. The encryption used is based on a PRNG using chaotic maps (Duffing, Logistic and 2d-Logistic) and the Middle-square Method. The goal of this project is to be a proof-of-concept and to create a platform that is cost-effective and can be expanded upon.
